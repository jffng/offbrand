        It is both a personal gesture made public towards processing sounds, aesthetics, and ideas consumed in the dance music milieu, and a play on the language of marketing and late capitalism — an attempt to resist the increasing commoditization of all aspects of creative life and imagine an alternative.
        </p>
        <p>
            Dance music is often understood and interpreted through functional (how does it make me move), aesthetic (what does it sound like), and political (to whom does it belong) perspectives. 
        </p>
        <p>
            While neither possible nor useful to detach from these contexts, my process and practice derives primarily from lived experience: what sounds and frequencies move me and why, what was the environment in which I heard them, what feelings do they arouse? Anticipation, longing, fear, heartache, grief, angst, release, hope — sometimes, not always, all at once. And how might reflections and interpretations of those emotions be shared in a way that subverts the self-exploitative nature of media and culture today?

            The expression that there is nothing to express, nothing with which to express, nothing from which to express, no power to express, no desire to express, together with the obligation to express.<br/>&emsp;— Samuel Beckett
        </em></p>
        <p>
            Synthesizing these ideas into works that resonate with others is something I feel I have yet to achieve, but will endeavor to try via platforms like this and with others whose creative visions align, in service of a scene, culture, and community of friends and collaborators that continues to shape me.
